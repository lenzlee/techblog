Bootcamp Module 14: Model-View-Controller (MVC) Challenge - Tech Blog

## MVC Challenge: Tech Blog
In this project, we were asked to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This site is completely built from scratch and deployed to Heroku. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
